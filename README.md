# scoop-bucket

Various buckets for personal use. 

* ar > Autorun (creates a shortcut in start up folder)
* np > Not portable (will run installer)
* cp > Config persist (usually in extras bucket without persist set up)

Some are from other sources but in the repo to ensure control. Credits below (where I have remembered).
